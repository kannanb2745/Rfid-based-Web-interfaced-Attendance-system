# Sign-In Page

## Overview
This project implements a simple sign-in system using Flask and MongoDB. Users authenticate by providing their Roll Number and Date of Birth (DOB). If valid, they are redirected to the dashboard; otherwise, they are redirected back to the sign-in page.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Validates user credentials using MongoDB.
- **Form Handling**: Extracts and processes user inputs from an HTML form.
- **Database Integration**: Uses MongoDB for storing and retrieving user records.
